        <h2>4. Ads and Monetization</h2>
        <p>Flashi integrates advertisements to support its development and maintenance. We use Start.io as a third-party service to display ads. Below is a detailed explanation of how ads are implemented:</p>
        
        <h3>Purpose of Ads</h3>
        <p>The inclusion of ads in FlashLearn provides financial support to sustain app development and keep it free for users. This funding allows us to release updates, introduce new features, and enhance the overall user experience.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Ads</h3>
        <p>To minimize disruption and maintain a user-friendly experience, the following types of ads are used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Banner Ads</strong>: Small, static ads displayed at the top or bottom of the interface, designed to be unobtrusive.</li>
            <li><strong>Interstitial Ads</strong>: Full-screen ads shown during natural app transitions, such as between activities or studying.</li>
            <li><strong>Rewarded Video Ads</strong>: Optional ads that users can watch voluntarily in exchange for in-app rewards, such as extra slots or bonuses.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>How Ads Work</h3>
        <p>Flashi uses Start.io to serve ads. Start.io may collect limited data, such as general device information and location, to provide relevant ads. For more details, refer to Start.io’s <a href="https://www.start.io/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>User Control and Consent</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>All ads served in Flashi comply with relevant data protection laws.</li>
            <li>Rewarded video ads remain entirely optional, giving users the choice to watch these ads for additional rewards.</li>
        </ul>
