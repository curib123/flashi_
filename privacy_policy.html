        <h2>4. Ads and Monetization</h2>
        <p>FlashLearn integrates advertisements to support its development and maintenance. We use Google AdMob as a third-party service to display non-personalized ads. Below is a detailed explanation of how ads are implemented:</p>
        
        <h3>Purpose of Ads</h3>
        <p>The inclusion of ads in FlashLearn provides financial support to sustain app development and keep it free for users. This funding allows us to release updates, introduce new features, and enhance the overall user experience.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Ads</h3>
        <p>To minimize disruption and maintain a user-friendly experience, the following types of ads are used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Banner Ads</strong>: Small, static ads displayed at the top or bottom of the interface, designed to be unobtrusive.</li>
            <li><strong>Interstitial Ads</strong>: Full-screen ads shown during natural app transitions, such as between activities or studying.</li>
            <li><strong>Rewarded Video Ads</strong>: Optional ads that users can watch voluntarily in exchange for in-app rewards, such as extra slots or bonuses.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>How Ads Work</h3>
        <p>FlashLearn uses Google AdMob to serve **non-personalized ads**, ensuring that no cookies, unique identifiers, or browsing data are used to tailor ads to individual users. Instead, ads are contextually relevant, based on general information like the app's content or the user’s general location (e.g., country or region). For more details, refer to Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>Use of Test Ads During Internal and Closed Testing</h3>
        <p>During the internal and closed testing phases of FlashLearn, we use **test ads** provided by Google AdMob. These test ads are placeholders that simulate real advertisements and are essential for ensuring the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Functionality Testing:</strong> Verifying that ad placements appear as intended without disrupting app performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Ensuring ads are displayed in compliance with app store guidelines and AdMob policies.</li>
            <li><strong>User Experience Optimization:</strong> Checking that ads are non-intrusive and align with the app's user-friendly design.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Test ads prevent unintended clicks or revenue generation during testing, ensuring a fair and accurate deployment when the app is officially released.</p>
        
        <h3>User Control and Consent</h3>
        <p>FlashLearn respects user preferences by offering transparency and control over advertisements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All ads served in FlashLearn during production are non-personalized, ensuring user data is not tracked for ad targeting.</li>
            <li>Rewarded video ads remain entirely optional, giving users the choice to watch these ads for additional rewards.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>FlashLearn uses Google AdMob to serve non-personalized advertisements within the app. During the testing phase, test ads are used to validate proper ad functionality. FlashLearn does not collect personal information directly. However, Google AdMob may collect basic contextual data, such as general location, to serve ads. </p>
        <p>For a detailed understanding of Google’s data handling practices, please refer to their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
