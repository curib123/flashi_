    <h1>Terms and Conditions for Flashi</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: 04/16/2025</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading and using the Flashi app, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms and Conditions, which form a legal agreement between you (the "User") and us (the "Developer"). If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the app.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>2. License to Use the App</h2>
    <p>We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use Flashi for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may install the app only on devices you own or control.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>3. Usage Restrictions</h2>
    <p>When using Flashi, you agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Distribute, copy, or share your flashcards in violation of any laws or third-party rights.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or tamper with the app’s source code or services.</li>
        <li>Use the app for illegal, malicious, or unauthorized purposes.</li>
        <li>Cause disruption to the app’s functionality or interfere with other users.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>4. User Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>Flashi does not require account creation or login. The app does not collect or store personal information.</p>
    <p>Flashi uses AI services, such as the Mistral API and Trivia API, to generate flashcards, chatbot responses, and daily quizzes. Your input is temporarily processed for these purposes only and is not stored or tracked.</p>
    <p>All app-generated content and files are stored locally on your device. You can export and import data manually using the app’s file features. For Android 13 and above, Flashi uses Scoped Storage, ensuring you control what files the app can access.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>5. Content Created by Users</h2>
    <p>As a user, you retain ownership of the flashcards you create. You are responsible for ensuring that your content:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does not contain illegal, harmful, or offensive material.</li>
        <li>Is backed up via the export feature if needed, as we do not store your data.</li>
        <li>Is used in accordance with these Terms and applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>6. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>Flashi is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied. We do not guarantee uninterrupted service, error-free functionality, or the accuracy of AI-generated or trivia content. Use the app at your own risk.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent allowed by law, we shall not be liable for any damages arising from your use of Flashi, including but not limited to loss of data, revenue, or content accuracy.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to Flashi at any time if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, you must stop using the app, and your license will be revoked.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Updates will be posted in-app or on our website. Continued use of Flashi after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact us:</p>
